        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The most familiar form of energy in our daily lives is electrical energy. The branch of engineering which deals with producing, managing and utilizing this energy, is referred to as electrical engineering. This field of engineering was introduced in an organized manner in the mid-19th century. The Department of Electronics Engineering was established in 1986 with the conversion of the then existing Industrial Engineering Department. The sanctioned intake of this department is 60 since its inception.</p>

            <h2>You Will Learn:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In a power generation plant where electrical energy is produced, the application of this engineering is huge. All the mechanical and as well as electrical equipment involved in producing electrical energy, such as alternators, boilers, turbines, etc. are controlled and protected by electrical signals.</li>
                <li>All the relays and switches involved in the operation of the equipment are either electrochemical or static electronics devices. In the modern age, these devices are digitally controlled by computer software.</li>
                <li>Power generation, electrical power transmission &amp; distribution, control &amp; power system protection, electrical switchgear, power transformers, control &amp; protection relays, transmission & distribution substations, and all switchyard equipment.</li>
                <li>Maintenance of Electric Supply.</li>
            </ul>
