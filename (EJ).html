        <p>The program in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering aims at training diploma engineers to select, operate, and maintain the communication facilities - and other related electronics systems - which are today being put in place in the government, semi-government, and private sectors, besides guiding them in the self-employment sector. We endeavor to enable our students to make use of opportunities in the fields of electronic exchanges, optical fiber lines satellite links, microwave links, mobile links, and other infrastructure, ranging to VLSI technologies. This branch of Engineering has a key place in the field of computers, information technology, Electrical. power system operations, communication system, etc.</p>
        <p>Er. Abdul Sayeed<br>Head of Department<br>The Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering was established in the year 2008 with an intake of 60 students. The main goal of the department is to provide students with quality education and continuous up-skilling so that they can succeed in the rapidly changing industry landscape. In addition to strong academic input, students are required to undertake projects and gain hands-on experience with both hardware and software tools. Industry visits and expert lectures from academia and industry professionals further enhance the learning experience. The students of the Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering department demonstrate outstanding academic performance, securing top university ranks and earning accolades for their achievements. They actively participate in national and international technical competitions, hackathons, and paper presentations, showcasing their skills and knowledge. The department encourages and supports students in presenting their work at conferences. Overall, it seems like the EXTC Department at MHSSCE is flourishing and making significant strides in research, academics, and extracurricular activities.</p>
