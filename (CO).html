        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Computer Engineering Department at MH Saboo Siddik Polytechnic. Our department offers high-quality education and training in computer engineering, equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed for successful careers in the field.
Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of computer science and electronic engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineering is referred to as computer science and engineering at some universities.<br>

Computer engineers require training in electronic engineering, computer science, hardware-software integration, software design, and software engineering. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, and can encompass areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also on how to integrate them into the larger picture.[2] Robotics are one of the applications of computer engineering.<br>

Computer engineering usually deals with areas including writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, analog sensors, mixed signal circuit boards, and operating systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.</p>
